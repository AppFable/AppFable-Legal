### Face Data Collection and Usage

Our app may include features that utilize facial analysis such as face detection, age estimation, or symmetry assessment.

**We do not collect, store, or share any face data.** When a user selects an image, it is **temporarily processed** through a third-party API solely to generate the requested result. The image is not stored on our servers or by the API provider, and is used only for the duration of the request. We do not retain any face data after processing, and we do not use such data for identification, tracking, profiling, or advertising purposes.

### Third-Party Service Providers (SDKs)

We may employ third-party companies and individuals (such as Google Firebase, advertising partners, or analytics SDKs) to facilitate our Service. These third parties have access to your Personal Information **only to perform tasks assigned to them on our behalf** and are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

## 🔒 Security

We use **strong security measures** to protect your personal information against unauthorized third-party access. However, no method for providing security to your information on the internet is 100% secure.
