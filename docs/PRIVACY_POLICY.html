        <h1>📄 AppFale Mobile Application Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Welcome to AppFale’s Privacy Policy. We take your information security very seriously and aim to provide the best possible security measures for the data you share with us. This policy explains how we <strong>collect, use, and protect your information</strong> when you use our mobile application (the "Service").</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>🤝 Consent</h2>

        <h2>💾 Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect information/data that relates to you (<strong>Personal Information</strong>) or data that does not relate to your personal identities (<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>). We may gather this data directly from you when you use our Service.</p>

        <h3>Personal Information:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Name, email address, phone number, and other contact information.</li>
            <li>Billing and payment details necessary to process transactions.</li>
            <li>Information you provide when filling out forms or communicating with us.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Device and Tracking Identifiers</h3>
        <p>We use unique mobile device identifiers (such as Advertising IDs and Device IDs) within the AppFale Service. These small pieces of data assist us in enhancing or maintaining your experience on our Service and in analyzing app usage patterns. You have the option to manage tracking settings through your device settings. By using or accessing our Service, you consent to our use of these identifiers.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>⚙️ How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We utilize the gathered information for a range of objectives, which encompass but are not confined to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing and <strong>improving our Service</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Personalizing your experience</strong> in the app.</li>

        <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or share any face data.</strong> When a user selects an image, it is <strong>temporarily processed</strong> through a third-party API solely to generate the requested result. The image is not stored on our servers or by the API provider, and is used only for the duration of the request. We do not retain any face data after processing, and we do not use such data for identification, tracking, profiling, or advertising purposes.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Service Providers (SDKs)</h3>
        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals (such as Google Firebase, advertising partners, or analytics SDKs) to facilitate our Service. These third parties have access to your Personal Information <strong>only to perform tasks assigned to them on our behalf</strong> and are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

        <hr>
